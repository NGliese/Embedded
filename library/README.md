# Library

This collection consists of multiple projects which each is ment to be portable ( used on eaither linux or bare metal platform ).
Every single project is setup in a unit test enviroment for TDD.


We are aiming for ~60% code coverage. Simple classes is not unit tested, complex classes is unit tested heavily.
