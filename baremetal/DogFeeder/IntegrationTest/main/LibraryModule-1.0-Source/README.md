# Library

This collection consists of multiple projects which each is ment to be portable ( used on eaither linux or bare metal platform ).
Every single project is setup in a unit test enviroment for TDD.


We are aiming for ~60% code coverage. Simple classes is not unit tested, complex classes is unit tested heavily.

## Tools used
Automated documentation is handled by doxygen, see [![Documentation ](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-doxygen-blue.svg)](https://ngliese.github.io/docs/html/) <br>
